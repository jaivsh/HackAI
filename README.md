# Temperature Alert Agent

Welcome to the Temperature Alert Agent project developed for the IIT Bombay Hack-AI Hackathon 2023. This agent helps users stay informed about real-time temperatures for a specified location and notifies them when the temperature goes beyond their comfort range.

## Features

- **Real-time Temperature Data**: The agent connects to a free weather API to fetch up-to-the-minute temperature information for a specific location.

- **User Preferences**: Users can set their preferred temperature range, specifying both minimum and maximum thresholds.

- **Alert Notifications**: Whenever the current temperature surpasses the user-set thresholds, the agent sends out instant alerts or notifications to keep users informed.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The agent offers an intuitive interface for interaction, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
